## Python Arduino

* A simple application for reading from the serial port where the arduino is connected and display the data to the temrinal,
* if the application sees a URL it will do a get request against that URL and display the response before continuing reading from the arduino

### Usage

`python arduinoClient.py 9600`

* Where that final number is the baud rate that the arduino has been set to in the serial setup.
* I.e if you have written

```
void loop() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
}
```
* Then the baud rate is 9600

* To quit do a CTRL-C and it will gracefully ask you if you are sure.
